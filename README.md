# 🛡️ Project Scope Guard

> **Scope is a contract with your future self.**

**Project Scope Guard** is a single‑page, offline‑first web app that helps you **define, lock, and protect project scope** before scope creep destroys focus, timelines, and motivation.

It is not a task manager.
It is not a planner.
It is a **discipline system**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Most projects fail for one reason:

> **The scope was never protected.**

Common problems:

* “Let me just add one more feature…”
* Projects that never feel *done*
* Overengineering before validation
* Burnout caused by unclear boundaries

Existing tools encourage **adding more**.

**Project Scope Guard exists to help you say NO early — and finish.**

---

## ✨ Core Philosophy

* Constraints create speed
* Clarity beats motivation
* Done is a decision, not a feeling
* Offline > Online
* Fewer features, stronger impact

This tool intentionally avoids:

* Accounts
* Backends
* Sync
* Analytics
* External APIs

Simplicity is a feature.
